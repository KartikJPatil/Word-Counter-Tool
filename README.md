This is my Second year Sem3 Project known as Word counter tool which is programmed in Java language.
This is an application which gives outputs such as frequencies of words,blank spaces,letters,alphabets,numbers,special characters,lines and paragraphs.
The Word Counter Tool app is a simple yet effective tool for tracking and analyzing word count in text. 
It allows users to paste or type in their content, providing an instant count of words, characters, and sentences. 
This app is valuable for writers, students, and professionals who need to meet specific word limits or analyze their writing patterns. 
With a user-friendly interface, it's a handy tool for enhancing productivity and maintaining precise word usage.
